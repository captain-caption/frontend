## The Project

- Summary of idea.

Captain Caption. Capture audio from web browser and present text subtitles in the browser.

- What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

In the world of remote work, accessibility has taken new meanings. Transcribed speech is essential for accessibility for those who are deaf and hard of hearing. Our goal is to make the remote workplace more accessible for all.

Browser listens to audio and then presents speech as text in the browser.
